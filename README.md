# TRACK MY BUS WEBSITE

Welcome to the **TRACK MY BUS** project! This is a fully functional prototype website developed to showcase ideas and concepts.  

I personally **worked on the entire prototype**, designing and implementing all features to provide a smooth and interactive user experience.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

In many cities and rural areas, public transportation systems face challenges such as lack of real-time tracking, poor passenger communication, inefficient route monitoring, and absence of instant alerts for delays or changes. Passengers often wait without knowing the exact arrival time of buses, while authorities lack centralized visibility into bus operations.

---

## 💡Solution Overview

This project presents a Smart Bus Monitoring & Alert System prototype developed as part of a Smart India Hackathon (SIH) demo.

The system provides:
1.web-based interface to display bus-related nformation

2.Real-time or simulated data using JSON

3.Visual representation of buses

4.Audio notifications for alerts or updates

The goal is to demonstrate how technology can enhance public transport visibility, passenger experience, and operational monitoring using a lightweight frontend-based solution.

---

## ✨ Key Features

1.🚍 Bus information display using structured data

2.🔔 Audio alert/notification system

3.🖥️ Interactive and responsive UI

4.📊 JSON-based data handling (easy to extend with APIs)

5.⚡ Lightweight, fast, and browser-based

6.🔧 Easy to deploy and customize

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

The project uses modern and reliable technologies:

- **HTML5** – Structure of the website  
- **CSS3** – Styling and responsiveness  
- **JavaScript** – Interactive features and dynamic behavior

Tools & Platforms:
Git & GitHub
VS Code
REST APIs

## 🏗 System Architecture
1.User (Browser)
↓
2.Frontend UI (HTML + CSS)
↓
3.JavaScript Logic (script.js)
↓
4.Bus Data Source (bus.json)
↓
5.UI Update + Notification (notify.mp3)

This modular structure allows easy future integration with:

1.Live GPS APIs
2.Backend servers
3.Databases

---

##⚙ Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
1.Any modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
2.Git (optional)

Steps:
1.Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/tripcoded/demo_sih.git
2.Navigate to the project folder:cd demo_sih
3.Open index.html in your browser:
Double-click the file
OR
Use Live Server extension in VS Code

---

## ▶ Usage

-Open the application in a browser

2-View bus-related information displayed on the UI

-Observe alerts or notifications triggered via audio

-Modify bus.json to simulate different bus data

This demo is designed for presentation, prototyping, and extension.
